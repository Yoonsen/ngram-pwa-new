  - Search multiple words simultaneously
  - Compare frequencies across different corpora (books and newspapers)
  - Support for multiple languages (BokmÃ¥l, Nynorsk, Sami languages, and Kven)
  - Real-time visualization updates

- **Advanced Visualization Options**
  - Relative frequency view
  - Absolute frequency view
  - Cumulative frequency analysis
  - Cohort analysis for comparing proportions
  - Smooth data visualization with adjustable year ranges
  - Interactive zoom and pan capabilities

- **User-Friendly Interface**
  - Clean, modern design
  - Intuitive drag-to-zoom functionality
  - Touch-device support
  - Responsive layout for all screen sizes
  - Easy-to-use language and corpus selection

- **Data Export Options**
  - Download visualizations as PNG
  - Export data as CSV
  - Export data as Excel spreadsheet

## Development Process and AI Assistance

This project serves as a case study for AI-assisted development, particularly in transitioning between different programming ecosystems. It demonstrates how teams with expertise in one technology stack (Python) can successfully develop modern web applications using different technologies (JavaScript/React) with AI assistance.

### Key Insights

#### Language Transition Success
- Successfully converted from Python/Dash/Plotly to React/JavaScript
- Maintained full functionality while modernizing the technology stack
- Achieved smooth transition despite team's primary Python background
- Preserved complex visualization features while improving user experience

#### AI as a Development Bridge
- AI tools provided contextual guidance for JavaScript/React ecosystem
- Handled complex transitions in:
  - Component architecture
  - State management
  - Modern UI implementation
  - API integration
- Translated Python development patterns to JavaScript equivalents
- Maintained code quality and best practices across languages

#### Collaborative Development Model
- Human expertise driving:
  - Data visualization requirements
  - Library selection
  - User experience design
  - Domain-specific features
- AI assistance with:
  - Technical implementation
  - Code structure
  - Best practices
  - Documentation
  - Problem-solving

#### Documentation and Knowledge Transfer
- Bilingual documentation (English/Norwegian)
